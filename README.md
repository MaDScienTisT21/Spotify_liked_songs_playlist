# Spotify Liked Songs into a Public Playlist

As we all know that there is no option to share the like songs. Hence, to overcome his problem, I created this python script to automate this process.

Add your client_id and client_secret in the secrets.py file.
Share the playlist and copy the playlist id inplaylist_id.

Then run the script.py file.
